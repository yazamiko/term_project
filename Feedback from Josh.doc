Feedback from Industrial Partner:
UI
●	Promotion and Item “Info” screen as great.  Like the list of items within the promotion
  ○	Adding one for Ad Events and including what promotions are tied to them would be a great addition

●	Great UI in general

●	Home screen improvements are good

●	Condensing the item screen and moving the validation to the right was good.  Much better than needing to scroll

●	Friendly Error Messages
  ○	Capturing the errors is good, however you want to make sure that the user to does see a “technical” error message.  You     should capture them and display a “friendly” error message to the user that lets them know what is wrong and how to correct it
Workflow

●	“Search All” functionality was added on almost all screens

●	Edit promotion information should “loop” like editing item information does

●	When adding a promotion to an Ad Event, it would be nice if somewhere it showed what Ad Event you were adding the promotions to

●	Notes when adding promotions to an Ad Event is good

●	Search and update item information was good

Overall your team made many improvements in Phase II.  The improvements in functionality made for a great demo with very few issues. Your team has addressed all of my comments from Phase I (other than adding the “Search All” on all searches, but you did add it on most).  Also all required Phase II work was completed and demoed without error.  The UI was great overall, and only had a small issue with the error messages.  I am looking forward to seeing how your reports look and what your team does with the Promotion-Ad Event notes in Phase III.
